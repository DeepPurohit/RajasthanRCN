# Problem Statement

There is currently no innovative way to engage the citizens in helping one another and also because of large number of cases there is a lot of pressure and burden of the police and the judiciary system. There is also a need of more vigilantism among the people themselves. This in the long run, shall help people be more aware of their surroundings, help each other and participate better in their societies.

## Because numbers don't lie





# Propsed Solution

## TL;DR

Rajasthan Complaint System is a distributed decentralized system/application to simplify transactions in the law and judiciary system.The RCN ables you to lodge complaints, both civil and criminal or major and minor.



This can be imagined as a modified version of the popular peer-to-peer network, incorporating <b>Cryptography</b>.
The blockchain’s security and privacy protocols are based on the use of a “cryptographic hash function” — each block (of transactions) in the chain is identified by its own “hash” key. This approach was developed to prevent the “double spending” of
Bitcoins. The complexity of the crypto hash function reduces the blockchain’s susceptibility to fraud.
This data contained in a blockchain is immutable, which means that it can't be changed. In this context, it's tamper-proof.

These Ethereum Smart Contracts are stored as special transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain, which you can then use to build applications. You can think of smart contracts sort of like API's.

These decentralized apps are defined by smart contracts. A smart contract allows individuals to exchange data in a trusted, conflict-free manner without relying on a third party like a bank, lawyer or notary.



# HOW IT WORKS
In case of a compaint, the citizen ought to register the complaint online that will reach all police accounts and the citizen shall not have to worry about jurisdictional issues, and neither will the policemen. 

If A looses her Voter ID Card, and B reads the complaint on the blockchain and finds the card near him. A may choose to offer a reward for the same which in case of successful finding and transfer of lost items, shall be transferred to B's account through the same network. 
This is an innovative way to engage the citizens in helping one another and also helps take the pressure off the police by de-centralizing the process and allowing for greater vigilantism among the people themselves. 
This in the long run, shall help people be more aware of their surroundings, help each other and participate better in their societies.
